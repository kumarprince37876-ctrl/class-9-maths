<li>Probability of an event: <b>P(E) = Number of favourable outcomes / Total number of outcomes</b></li>
<li>Probability of certain event: P(E) = 1</li>
<li>Probability of impossible event: P(E) = 0</li>
<li>Sum of probabilities of all elementary events = 1</li>
<li>Complementary event: <b>P(not E) = 1 – P(E)</b></li>
<li>0 ≤ P(E) ≤ 1</li>
</ul>

<p class="example"><b>Example 1:</b> Tossing a coin: P(heads) = 1/2, P(tails) = 1/2</p>
<p class="example"><b>Example 2:</b> Rolling a die: P(4) = 1/6, P(even number) = 3/6 = 1/2</p>
